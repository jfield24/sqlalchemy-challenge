# SQLAlchemy - Climate Analysis and Exploration

---

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to use Python and SQLAlchemy to conduct climate analysis and data exploration of a Hawaii climate database. A Flask API was designed based on some of the queries developed.
- The `climate_starter.ipynb` notebook contains climate analysis and exploration using SQLAlchemy, Pandas and Matplotlib
- The `app.py` file contains the Flask API.
